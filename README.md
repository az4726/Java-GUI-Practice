# Java-GUI-Practice

This repository contains programs with GUIs, that have been created using Scenebuilder and the Netbeans IDE. I decided to do this to gain more experience using JavaFX and implementing GUIs.

## Getting Started

Download the repository as a zip and extract it to a location of your choosing. In Netbeans, set the folder as your workspace to view the project folders. Each project can now be run individually.
